# Smart_Assistant-EZ-
# ü§ñ Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

An intelligent local assistant that allows users to upload a research document (PDF/TXT) and interact with it using two powerful modes:

- ‚úÖ **Ask Anything**: Ask free-form questions from the document.
- üéØ **Challenge Me**: Attempt AI-generated logical/comprehension questions with feedback.
- üìå **Auto Summary**: Automatically generate a 150-word summary of the uploaded content.

> Built using **Python 3.12**, **Streamlit**, **Transformers**, and **TensorFlow** ‚Äì no PyTorch used.

### üß† Reasoning Flow

#### 1. File Upload (PDF/TXT)
- Handled via Streamlit.
- PDF text extracted using **PyMuPDF**.
- TXT read as plain UTF-8 text.

#### 2. Auto Summary
- Runs on upload.
- Uses `google/pegasus-xsum` model via ü§ó `transformers` with TensorFlow backend.
- Trims input to 1024 tokens for efficiency.
- Summary limited to 150 words.

#### 3. Ask Anything Mode
- Uses `distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad` for QA via `pipeline("question-answering")`.
- Returns:
  - **Answer**
  - **Justification** (based on context match)

#### 4. Challenge Me Mode
- Uses `valhalla/t5-small-qa-qg-hl` to generate 3 questions from random sentences.
- Evaluates your input with basic scoring and document-backed feedback.
- Simulated evaluation via basic logic for lightweight local execution.
